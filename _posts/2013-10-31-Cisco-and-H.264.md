I had a bad feeling when i first read that cisco found a loop hole in the licensing of H.264 and will provide binary blobs to firefox so it can be used for webrtc and pay for the fees. There is maximum amount a company have to pay so it seems to be good deal.

Now we should trust cisco that they will not [install any back door][l3] [in the binary][l2] [blobs for the][l1] [nsa][gl]. Even if there is no back door and the people start to use the patent infected algorithm and cisco decides to stop to pay for the fees, what will happen.

As [fefe][fefe] mention in his [blog post] it will also destroy the competion for the best/fastest h.264 implementation.

You might also read the [blog post of monty][xiph] the guy behind ogg vorbis and daala.
