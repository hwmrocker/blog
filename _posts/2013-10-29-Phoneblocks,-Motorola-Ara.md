[Motorola has now a concept][ara] for a modular cell phone. I saw a few months ago the [concept of phoneblocks][blocks]. Their motivation is to build a phone that can be upgraded partially, so you don't have to throw away your phone just because the cpu is too slow now, so you can just exchange the block for the cpu.

If you like the idea and have constructive input, [you can give your input to motorola via dscout][arad].
