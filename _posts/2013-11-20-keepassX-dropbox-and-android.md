You might heard of the resent hack on Adobe where millions of bad encrypted passwords where stolen and leaked. If not just [google "password leak"][link] and you can see that this happens quite often.

Those people who reuse there password are now in great danger. Everybody could now check for a specific email address, get the password and try to login to facebook or gmail. That made me think. I also used to reuse a lot of passwords. I have to log in to about 40 different accounts per week and i cannot, or just don't want to remember 40 different passwords.

Now I am using [KeepassX][kee] to store a different password for each website. I have just to remember one strong password and I can lookup every password in a second. The login is now much faster when I had to probe my 3-4 common passwords. You can also let it type the username and password for you. I sync my key-database with dropbox, so each of my laptops has the most recent version of keys. It will work when I am offline (after I synced the keys). And there is also an [android app][keed] that will let me look up the passwords from my phone and dropbox even when I am not at home. 

And for the Windows and Mac folks, KeepassX is also available for your OS.
