If you have a rooted android device, you should consider to [install a firewall][fdroid] that will block access to the internet per app. So you can even [install bad apps][bad] that would collect your private data and or sending you a lot of spam adds without to worry about your privacy.

I used DroidWall but the development stopped. There is [an active fork, call AFWall+][fdroid].

* You can import and export the firewall rules.
* Search for applications.
* You can limit the access to WIFI, cellular network, and roaming for each app.

If you like the app very much you can [buy a pro version with the same feature set at the play store.]
